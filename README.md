# CASE STUDY: Developing a webscraper using C#-based Selenium browser automation

For the course of DevOps, I chose the case study concerning webscraping. This case study consists of 3 parts:

1) Webscraper for YouTube data
2) Webscraper for a jobsite
3) Webscraper for stock info (via google finance)

Feel free to look around
